                                    <p>Dear Intersect & Community,</p>
                                    <p>First, let me acknowledge the effort that's gone into crafting this proposed future roadmap. Aligning a global community around shared priorities is like herding cats, except the cats are all on Twitter, and half of them are yelling about memecoins. So, kudos for even attempting this.</p>
                                    <p>However, after careful consideration, I must vote NO on this info action. This is because I believe we need to address critical gaps in the governance process before locking in long-term priorities.</p>

                                    <h3>1. DRep Compensation</h3>
                                    <p>When I signed up to be a DRep, I thought it would be part-time volunteer work, a way to give back to the ecosystem I love. But this roadmap makes it clear that being a DRep is going to be more than that. A lot more. We're talking about evaluating hundreds (if not thousands) of proposals, getting into technical details, and making decisions that will shape Cardano's future for years to come. Expecting DReps to do this without compensation is like asking someone to run a marathon while carrying a fridge. Some of the Dreps might manage it for a while, but eventually, we're going to get tired. And when we do, who's left to govern? Only those who can afford to work for free. This then creates a privilege filter that excludes diverse voices and undermines the very decentralization we're trying to achieve.</p>
                                    <p>I'm not saying this because I want to get paid. I started this journey with 39 ADA and a dream, and I'm more than happy to keep volunteering. But if we want governance to be sustainable, we need to address this issue head-on. Let's tie DRep compensation to participation, maybe through staking rewards for voting activity or a similar mechanism.</p>
                                    <p class="ask-highlight">My Ask: Address DRep compensation before finalizing the roadmap. Otherwise, we're just building a system where only the independently wealthy can afford to govern.</p>

                                    <h3>2. Grassroots Projects: Meritocracy â‰  Monopoly</h3>
                                    <p>The roadmap will shape funding priorities for years to come, but without safeguards, it risks sidelining grassroots innovators in favor of established players. And as someone who started with 39 ADA, I know firsthand how hard it can be for smaller voices to be heard.</p>
                                    <p>Too often, smaller projects with great ideas lose out to polished proposals from big teams. It's like watching a high school science fair where one kid shows up with a particle accelerator. Sure, the particle accelerator is impressive, but what about the kid with the homemade volcano? That volcano might not be as flashy, but it could still change the world.</p>
                                    <p>The old Intersect model gave smaller projects a fighting chance by providing structured support. Without similar safeguards, we risk creating a system where only the loudest voices win. And that's not the Cardano I believe in.</p>
                                    <p class="ask-highlight">My Ask: Reserve a portion of future funding for grassroots projects, (e.g under $50k asks, and provide mentorship programs to level the playing field. Let's make sure the next great idea doesn't get lost because it came from someone without a PR team.</p>

                                    <h3>3. The Snake Eating Its Own Tail</h3>
                                    <p>This proposed roadmap will guide budget decisions for years to come, but I don't see any clear rules to prevent conflicts of interest. Without them, we risk creating a closed loop where the same players fund the same projects. Now, I'm not saying DReps won't be moral. Of course, we will 9or atleast we will try to be). We're all here because we love Cardano and want the best for it. But what if we're not? What if the pressure to deliver results or the lure of personal gain clouds our judgment? Trust is great, but checks and balances are better.</p>
                                    <p>Even unintentional bias can creep in. When a DRep's project gets funded, it sets a precedent. Soon, you've got DRep Inc....a cozy club of proposals written by, voted on by, and funded by the same folks. I don't have all the answers, but this is a conversation we need to have. For example, we could implement rules like "DReps can't vote on proposals they submit" or "mandatory transparency on conflicts."</p>
                                    <p>If DReps can submit and vote on their own proposals, the system becomes a governance ouroboros, a snake eating its own tail. We've seen this before in Catalyst, where the same faces keep winning while smaller projects struggle to get noticed. Let's not repeat those mistakes.</p>

                                    <p class="ask-highlight">My Ask: Implement conflict-of-interest rules before finalizing the roadmap. Ban DReps from voting on proposals they submit or require full transparency on conflicts. (e.g My uncle wrote this).</p>

                                    <h3>4. Building Bridges for Communities</h3>
                                    <p>My DRep campaign is built around the idea of building bridges and connecting communities that rarely talk, amplifying voices that have been told they're too small, too far, or too different to make a difference.</p>
                                    <p>But this roadmap doesn't do enough to address the barriers that keep so many communities from participating. Language barriers, geographic isolation, and lack of resources are real challenges, and they're not going away on their own.</p>
                                    <p>Where's the plan for translating governance materials into more languages? Where's the support for communities in underrepresented regions? Let's build bridges, not walls, and make sure everyone has a seat at the table.</p>
                                    <p>I don't think the roadmap itself is wrong. In fact, I think it's a great starting point. But before we lock in long-term priorities, we need to address these gaps. Let's pause, refine, and return with a governance process that's fair, sustainable, and truly decentralized.</p>
                                    <p>Cardano's governance is a historic experiment. Let's not rush into a system that risks replicating the centralized pitfalls we're trying to escape.</p>
                                    <p>I'm optimistic we can fix this. Let's collaborate, refine, and return with a roadmap and governance process that's not just decentralized in name, but in practice. When we do, you'll have my enthusiastic "yes." Until then, I vote NO, with hope, humility, and a stubborn belief that Cardano can do better.</p>

You're about to push your code live, and suddenly you're thinking, "Maybe I should just reorganize the entire file structure... and rewrite all the comments... and maybe switch to a different framework while I'm at it?" That's exactly where we are with the Cardano Constitution right now.</p>
                                    <p>And I can hear some folks saying, "But what if we vote no? Then we can make it perfect!" Here's the thing about perfect: it's the comfy couch of development. It feels nice to sit there and dream about it, but nothing actually gets shipped while you're sitting on that couch.</p>
                                    <p>Over 1,400 people from 52 countries contributed to this document. That's like having the biggest, most diverse code review in history. And unlike that time someone reviewed my code and just wrote "??" on every line (true story), these contributors actually put in thoughtful work.</p>

                                <div class="rationale-content enhanced full-width container-fluid p-0">
                                    <p>Now, what if we vote no? Well, let me paint that picture: we go back to the drawing board, spend months debating commas and semicolons, whether we should use "shall" or 'will', "ada" or ADA, lovelace or #"shoelaces" (And don't even get me started on equitable and fairly...) Meanwhile, other blockchains will be moving forward. The beauty of this Constitution is that it's not in an ancient scroll surrounded by people with powdered wigs protecting it. It's got an amendment process built in and we've got governance workshops planned for 2025. And let's talk about that amendment process for a second. It's not like the old days where you'd need to find someone with a fancy quill pen to make changes. We can actually update this thing without having to organize a continental congress or whatever they did back in the day. Though I guess a continental congress would make for some interesting Zoom calls...</p>
                                    <p>In my experience, the best systems aren't born perfect - they evolve. Remember when JavaScript was just that thing you used to make annoying pop-ups? Look at it now. (Though some might argue it's still just for making annoying pop-ups, but that's a debate for another day.) The Cardano Constitution is our chance to start with something good and make it better over time. It's like launching any new project - you start with something solid and improve it based on real feedback. If we wait for perfect, we'll be waiting forever. So yeah, I vote YES. Not because it's perfect - it's not even close. I vote YES because it's good, it's solid, and most importantly, it's improvable. We're not carving this in stone tablets or writing it with those fancy feather pens. We're writing it in a format that can evolve with our community.</p>
                                    <p>Think of it this way: if Web 1.0 developers had waited for the perfect solution, we'd still be arguing about whether this whole "internet thing" was going to catch on. Sometimes you need to get started and trust in your ability to improve things over time.</p>
                                    <p>So let's do this. Let's move. And then, just like with everything else worth doing, we'll make it better together.</p>
