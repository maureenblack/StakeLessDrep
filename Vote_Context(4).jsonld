    "comment": "Dear Intersect & Community,\nFirst, let me acknowledge the effort that’s gone into crafting this proposed future roadmap. Aligning a global community around shared priorities is like herding cats, except the cats are all on Twitter, and half of them are yelling about memecoins. So, kudos for even attempting this.  \nHowever, after careful consideration, I must vote NO on this info action. This is because I believe we need to address critical gaps in the governance process before locking in long-term priorities.  \n\n1. DRep Compensation.  \n\nWhen I signed up to be a DRep, I thought it would be part-time volunteer work, a way to give back to the ecosystem I love. But this roadmap makes it clear that being a DRep is going to be more than that. A lot more. We’re talking about evaluating hundreds (if not thousands) of proposals, getting into technical details, and making decisions that will shape Cardano’s future for years to come.  Expecting DReps to do this without compensation is like asking someone to run a marathon while carrying a fridge. Some of the Dreps might manage it for a while, but eventually, we’re going to get tired. And when we do, who’s left to govern? Only those who can afford to work for free. This then creates a privilege filter that excludes diverse voices and undermines the very decentralization we’re trying to achieve.  \nI’m not saying this because I want to get paid. I started this journey with 39 ADA and a dream, and I’m more than happy to keep volunteering. But if we want governance to be sustainable, we need to address this issue head-on. Let’s tie DRep compensation to participation, maybe through staking rewards for voting activity or a similar mechanism. \nMy Ask: Address DRep compensation before finalizing the roadmap. Otherwise, we’re just building a system where only the independently wealthy can afford to govern.  \n\n2. Grassroots Projects: Meritocracy ≠ Monopoly  \nThe roadmap will shape funding priorities for years to come, but without safeguards, it risks sidelining grassroots innovators in favor of established players. And as someone who started with 39 ADA, I know firsthand how hard it can be for smaller voices to be heard.  \n\nToo often, smaller projects with great ideas lose out to polished proposals from big teams. It’s like watching a high school science fair where one kid shows up with a particle accelerator. Sure, the particle accelerator is impressive, but what about the kid with the homemade volcano? That volcano might not be as flashy, but it could still change the world.  \nThe old Intersect model gave smaller projects a fighting chance by providing structured support. Without similar safeguards, we risk creating a system where only the loudest voices win. And that’s not the Cardano I believe in.  \nMy Ask: Reserve a portion of future funding for grassroots projects, (e.g under $50k asks, and provide mentorship programs to level the playing field. Let’s make sure the next great idea doesn’t get lost because it came from someone without a PR team.  \n                                                                                                                                                                             \n3. The Snake Eating Its Own Tail \n   This proposed roadmap will guide budget decisions for years to come, but I don’t see any clear rules to prevent conflicts of interest. Without them, we risk creating a closed loop where the same players fund the same projects. Now, I’m not saying DReps won’t be moral. Of course, we will 9or atleast we will try to be). We’re all here because we love Cardano and want the best for it. But what if we’re not? What if the pressure to deliver results or the lure of personal gain clouds our judgment? Trust is great, but checks and balances are better.\nEven unintentional bias can creep in. When a DRep’s project gets funded, it sets a precedent. Soon, you’ve got DRep Inc....a cozy club of proposals written by, voted on by, and funded by the same folks. I don’t have all the answers, but this is a conversation we need to have. For example, we could implement rules like \"DReps can’t vote on proposals they submit\" or \"mandatory transparency on conflicts.\"\n\nIf DReps can submit and vote on their own proposals, the system becomes a governance ouroboros, a snake eating its own tail. We’ve seen this before in Catalyst, where the same faces keep winning while smaller projects struggle to get noticed. Let’s not repeat those mistakes. \nWe’ve seen this before in Catalyst, where the same faces keep winning while smaller projects struggle to get noticed. Let’s not repeat those mistakes.  \nLet us implement conflict-of-interest rules before finalizing the roadmap. Ban DReps from voting on proposals they submit or require full transparency on conflicts.  \nI believe in building bridges and connecting communities that rarely talk, amplifying voices that have been told they’re too small, too far, or too different to make a difference. \nBut this roadmap doesn’t do enough to address the barriers that keep so many communities from participating. \nI don’t think the roadmap itself is wrong. In fact, I think it’s a great starting point. But before we lock in long-term priorities, we need to address these gaps. Let’s pause, refine, and return with a governance process that’s fair, sustainable, and truly decentralized.  \nCardano’s governance is a historic experiment. Let’s not rush into a system that risks replicating the centralized pitfalls we’re trying to escape.  \nI’m optimistic we can fix this. Let’s collaborate, refine, and return with a roadmap and governance process that’s not just decentralized in name, but in practice. When we do, you’ll have my enthusiastic \"yes.\" Until then, I vote NO, with hope, humility, and a stubborn belief that Cardano can do better.  "
