    "motivations": "I started this journey with 39 ADA and a dream of making governance work for everyone. Being a DRep isn't about having the biggest wallet; it's about having the biggest heart for the community. And I do. So why am I a DRep? Because I love Cardano.",
    "objectives": "My Top 3 Objectives.\n1.  Building Bridges. I'm a bridge between communities that rarely talk. My mission is to be the voice for those who've been told they're too small, too far, too different to make a difference.  From Africa to Japan and everywhere in between, good ideas know no borders. \n2.  Community Education. I'll push for dashboards, translation resources, and educational platforms that make governance accessible to everyone, not just tech experts.\n3.  Push for Better. \nIf something doesn't make sense, I'll call it out. I am not here to make everyone \"comfortable\". Comfort isn't the same as correct and Cardano deserves the best.\n\nThis isn't your typical DRep pitch because I'm not your typical DRep.  I'm here to rewrite the rules.",

    "qualifications": "-Fullstack Developer | MERN Stack \n-Constitutional Delegate, Cameroon | Douala Workshop 2024\n-Public Administration Degree\nI'm not here to impress you with a fancy resume, but i believe my most profound credential is an almost embarrassingly passionate obsession with the Cardano ecosystem.
