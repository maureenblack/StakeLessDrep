        <h1>I Voted NO on Cutting the Treasury Tax to 10%. Here's why.</h1>

            <span class="vote-no">Voted: No</span>
            <span>February 17th, 2025</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>Alright, let's cut to the chase. This proposal wants to slash the treasury tax from 20% to 10% to boost staking rewards. Sounds great on paper, right? More rewards for everyone! But hold up, let me explain why I'm slamming the brakes on this one.</p>
            <blockquote>
                "Don't worry, guys! Our financial plan is basically crossing our fingers and yelling 'TO THE MOON!' at our screens."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>1. "Treasury sustainability depends on ADA price appreciation!" Cool story, bro.</h2>
            <p>The proposal argues that even with a lower tax, the treasury will stay afloat because ADA's price will moon. Let me translate that: "Don't worry, guys! Our financial plan is basically crossing our fingers and yelling 'TO THE MOON!' at our screens." Sorry, but that's not a strategy, it's a meme.</p>
            
            <p>I love ADA as much as the next person, but banking on price spikes to fund our ecosystem is like relying on your neighbor's rooster to wake you up every morning. Sure, it works most days, but what happens when the rooster decides to sleep in? Or God forbid, your neighbor cooks it for dinner?</p>
            
            <p>See where I'm going with this? If ADA's price doesn't rise as expected, we could find ourselves with an underfunded treasury and a lot of awkward questions. Hope is not a strategy. And this proposal feels a bit too hopeful for my taste.</p>

            <h2>2. "This will improve decentralization!" ...Will it, though?</h2>
            <p>The proposal argues that reducing the treasury tax will improve decentralization by incentivizing more people to stake. That's a noble goal, but let's not forget that decentralization is a delicate dance.</p>
            
            <p>Big stakeholders and whales already have an outsized influence. If we increase rewards too much, we might inadvertently favor larger stakeholders, who can afford to run bigger pools. Smaller pools, the backbone of true decentralization, could get squeezed out.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Decentralization isn't about showering everyone with ADA, it's about fairness."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>3. "The original 20% tax was arbitrary!" Yeah, and?</h2>
            <p>The proposal throws shade at the original 20% tax for being "arbitrary" (fair point) but then replaces it with... another arbitrary number: 10%. Wait, what?</p>
            
            <p>"Hey, that old number was random, so let's pick a new random one!" How about we, I don't know, do the math first? Where's the analysis showing 10% is the sweet spot? Where's the stress-testing for worst-case scenarios? If we're gonna change a critical parameter, let's at least bring receipts.</p>

            <h2>4. "Trust the governance process!" I do. That's why I'm voting NO.</h2>
            <p>I believe governance is about asking the hard questions. One of my biggest concerns is the lack of a clear plan for what happens if the treasury becomes underfunded. The proposal doesn't include a sunset clause, a review mechanism, or even a "break glass in case of emergency" plan.</p>
            
            <p>If we're going to make such a significant change, we need to have safeguards in place. Otherwise, we're just crossing our fingers and hoping for the best and that's not how I like to make decisions.</p>

            <p>Let's come back with one that includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A phased reduction (20% to 15% or 12.5% to 10%), not a free fall.</li>
                <li>A backup plan if ADA's price does a disappearing act.</li>
                <li>Protections for small pools and builders who rely on the treasury.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="signature">
                <p><strong>P.S.</strong> I'm not against change. I'm against reckless change.</p>
                <p>Let's not burn through the treasury's resources for a quick dopamine hit. Cardano deserves better.</p>
