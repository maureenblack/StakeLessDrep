                                <p>The Stakeless Manifesto: A Governance Struggle Story</p>
                                <p>You ever walk into a room and immediately realize you don’t belong here?</p>
                                <p>Maybe it’s a fancy restaurant where the waiter looks at you like you’re lost. Maybe it’s a high-level Cardano discussion where everyone is throwing around words like "constitutional governance," and you’re just trying to figure out why there are 27 documents and none of them explain things in normal human language.</p>
                                <p>Yeah. Been there.</p>
                                <p>I know what it’s like to be stakeless.</p>
                                <p>I know what it’s like to have ideas but no big name backing me.</p>
                                <p>I know what it’s like to want to contribute but be hit with governance jargon like a slap from a Nollywood movie.</p>
                                <p>I know what it’s like to struggle through technical discussions while secretly Googling words under the table.</p>
                                <p>I know what it’s like to feel like I need a PhD, a blockchain lab coat, and a secret handshake just to vote properly.</p>
                                <p>But here’s the thing: governance is supposed to be for everyone.</p>
                                <p>Not just for the governance experts.</p>
                                <p>Not just for the ones who speak perfect English (or Japanese, or French, or… pick your poison).</p>
                                <p>Not just for the ones who have been here since Byron era and remember when Cardano was just a baby.</p>
                                <p>Not just for the ones who confidently throw around words like “quadratic voting” while I’m still figuring out regular voting.</p>
                                <p>Governance should be for the people who show up, no matter their ADA balance, their background, or whether they’ve read all the Catalyst reports or just the memes.</p>
                                <p>But the stakeless? We’ve been ignored.</p>
                                <p>The ones who want to participate but feel too shy to unmute.</p>
                                <p>The ones who are excited about Cardano but get lost in the sea of documents.</p>
                                <p>The ones who read a governance proposal three times and still don’t understand what’s being proposed.</p>
                                <p>The ones who sit in spaces thinking, I have something to say… but what if it’s dumb?</p>
                                <p>I refuse to let governance be an exclusive club where only the loudest, richest, or most confident voices matter.</p>
                                <p>We need to make governance understandable. Not just for the professors, but for your cousin, your neighbor, and even your grandma who still thinks blockchain is a fancy Excel sheet.</p>
                                <p>We need to make governance accessible. A truly decentralized system should work in multiple languages and be simple enough that anyone can participate.</p>
                                <p>We need to make governance fun. Because let’s be honest—if it feels like homework, people will ignore it. And you know we all have that one Catalyst proposal we meant to read but never did.</p>
                                <p>We need to make governance safe. No one should feel like their opinion doesn’t matter just because they don’t have the perfect words or the right connections.</p>
                                <p>So yeah, I’m here.</p>
                                <p>For the ones who feel lost.</p>
                                <p>For the ones who don’t have big ADA bags but still want a say.</p>
                                <p>For the ones who secretly watch governance calls but never speak.</p>
                                <p>For the ones who are tired of pretending they understand governance when they really just want a simple, clear explanation.</p>
                                <p>No more locked doors.</p>
                                <p>No more feeling stupid for asking questions.</p>
                                <p>No more making governance feel like an elite club where only the chosen ones understand what’s happening.</p>
                                <p>We all move Tomo ni mae e (forward together).</p>
                                <p>Even if we trip a little along the way.</p>
